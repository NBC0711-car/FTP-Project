# FTP-Project

## Description
The purpose of this project is to make a FTP server so people could use it to upload or download files that are saved in our server, also this project is public so people can know how to create an FTP server with a few tools.
We are going to use Vagrant in order to create the Virtual Machines, also, we are going to use ansible to automatizate all the tasks needed to configure the FTP server, and with that we will also need ansible-lint to test the quality of our code. Another aditional tools used are github along with github projects and also a Virtual Machine or a device that works as a client.
